<h2 id="grade-10intro-to-computer-studies">Grade 10<br>
Intro to computer studies</h2>
<p>A1.2 Describe the functions of the internal components of a computer<br>
<small>(e.g., CPU, RAM, ROM, cache, hard drive, motherboard, power supply, video card, sound card);</small></p>
<p>B1.3 explain the difference between constants and variables used in programming;</p>
<p>B1.4 determine the expressions and instructions to use in a programming statement, taking into account the order of operations<br>
<small><em>(e.g., precedence of arithmetic operators, assignment operators, and relational operators);</em> </small></p>
<p>B1.5 identify situations in which decision and looping structures are required;</p>
<p>B1.6 describe the function of Boolean operators (e.g., AND, OR, NOT), <u>comparison operators</u> <small><br>
(i.e., equal to, not equal to, greater than, less than, greater than or equal to, less than or equal to),</small></p>
<p>and <u>arithmetic operators</u><br>
<em><small>(e.g., addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, parentheses), and use them correctly in programming</small></em></p>
<hr>
<p>By the end of this course, students will:</p>
<p>B2.1 use a visual problem-solving model (e.g., IPO [Input, Process, Output] chart;<br>
HIPO [Hierarchy plus Input, Process, Output] chart and diagram; flow chart; storyboard) to plan the content of a program;</p>
<p>B2.2 use variables, expressions, and assignment statements to store and manipulate numbers and text in a program <em><small>(e.g., in a quiz program, in a unit conversion program);</small></em></p>
<p>B2.3 write keyboard input and screen output statements that conform to program specifications;</p>
<p>B2.4 write a program that includes a decision structure for two or more choices<br>
<small>(e.g., guessing game, rock-paper-scissors game, multiple-choice quiz, trivia game); </small></p>
<p>B2.5 write programs that use looping structures effectively<br>
<small>(e.g., simple animation, simple board games, coin toss); </small></p>
<p>B2.6 explain the difference between syntax, logic, and run-time errors;</p>
<p>B2.7 compare and contrast the use of different programming environments to solve the same problem <small>(e.g., a solution developed in a programming language versus one developed using a spreadsheet)</small></p>
<hr>
<p>By the end of this course, students will:</p>
<p>B3.1 write clear and maintainable code using proper programming standards <small>(e.g., indentation; naming conventions for constants, variables, and expressions); </small></p>
<p>B3.2 write clear and maintainable internal documentation to a specific set of standards <small>(e.g., program header: author, revision date, program name, program description; table of variable names and descriptions); </small></p>
<p>B3.3 use a tracing technique to understand program flow and to identify and correct logic and run-time errors in a computer program;</p>
<p>B3.4 demonstrate the ability to validate a computer program using test cases.</p>
